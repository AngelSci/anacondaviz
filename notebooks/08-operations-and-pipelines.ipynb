    "When interactively exploring a dataset you often end up interleaving visualization and analysis code. Since in HoloViews your visualization and your data are one and the same, analysis and data transformations can be applied directly to the visualizable data. For that purpose HoloViews provides operations, which can be used to implement any analysis or data transformation you might want to do.\n",

    "Since Operations know about HoloViews you can apply them to large collections of data collected in HoloMap and DynamicMap containers.

This feature allows us to chain multiple operations in a data analysis, processing and visualization pipeline and drive the operation of a dashboard.\n",
